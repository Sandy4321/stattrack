# stattrack

Stattrack is python program I started writing to give me an edge with Fantasy Sports Drafts.

It currently supports an NFL auction style draft -- and I plan to support other leagues (NHL for sure) and other draft formats as I enter those drafts. I'm sharing it since I put way too much effort into this for it to only be used by me.
